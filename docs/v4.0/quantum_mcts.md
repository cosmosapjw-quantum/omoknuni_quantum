# Quantum-Inspired Monte Carlo Tree Search: Rigorous Theory

## Executive Summary

This document presents the mathematical theory of quantum-inspired Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We show that tree search naturally exhibits quantum mechanical behavior when viewed through information time $\tau = \log(N+2)$, with coherent exploration competing against dissipative measurement.

**Key Results**:
- Path integral formulation on 1D directed lattice yields diagonal Hessian
- Effective Planck constant $\hbar_{\text{eff}}(N) = \hbar[1 + \Gamma_N/2]$ emerges from Lindblad dynamics
- PUCT formula derived from stationary action principle
- RG flow predicts $c_{\text{PUCT}} \sim N^{-1/2}$ decay
- Crossover (not phase transition) separates quantum/classical regimes
- Phase interference enables natural parallel coordination

**Note**: Implementation details, validation code, and engineering considerations are provided in the companion Engineering Appendix.

**Implementation Update**: This document reflects critical corrections to ensure mathematical consistency: (1) discrete information time evolution $\delta\tau_N = 1/(N_{\text{root}} + 2)$, (2) Hamiltonian derived via proper Legendre transformation, (3) causality-preserving operator evaluation with pre-update visit counts, and (4) classical action computed as KL divergence to ensure proper scaling and numerical stability.

## Part I: Mathematical Foundations

### 1. Information Time

**Definition 1.1** (Information Time):
$$\tau(N) = \log(N + 2)$$

**Theorem 1.1** (Information-Theoretic Derivation):
Let $I_N$ be the total information gained from $N$ simulations. Under the assumption of diminishing returns:
$$\frac{dI_N}{dN} = \frac{c}{N + \alpha}$$

Integrating with boundary condition $I_0 = 0$:
$$I_N = c[\log(N + \alpha) - \log(\alpha)]$$

Setting $\alpha = 2$ (minimal regularization) and $\tau \equiv I_N/c + \log(2)$ gives the result. □

### 2. Path Space and Measure

**Definition 2.1** (Configuration Space):
A path of ply depth $L$ is:
$$\gamma = (u_0, u_1, \ldots, u_{L-1}) \in \Gamma_L$$
where $u_k = (s_k, a_k)$ and $s_{k+1} = f(s_k, a_k)$.

**Lemma 2.1** (Measurability):
Since $\Sigma_{u_k}$ is countable for each $k$, the path space measure
$$\sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma_L} = \sum_{u_0 \in \Sigma_{s_0}} \sum_{u_1 \in \Sigma_{u_0}} \cdots$$
is well-defined by Fubini's theorem. □

### 3. Action Functional

**Definition 3.1** (Lagrangian Density):
$$\mathcal{L}(u_k; N^{\text{pre}}) = \log[N^{\text{pre}}(u_k) + \varepsilon_N] + \lambda \log P(u_k) - \beta Q(u_k)$$

where:
- $N^{\text{pre}}(u_k) \geq 0$: pre-rollout visit count
- $P(u_k) \in (0,1]$: neural network prior
- $Q(u_k) \in [-1,1]$: backed-up value
- $\varepsilon_N > 0$: visit regularization parameter

**Important Note**: The classical action should be computed as the KL divergence from the prior:
$$S_{\text{cl}} = \sum_k N_k \log(N_k) - N_{\text{total}} \log(N_{\text{total}}) + N_{\text{total}} \log(K)$$
This ensures proper extensive scaling and numerical stability. See `classical_action_correction.md` for details.

**Theorem 3.1** (PUCT from Stationary Action):
Under the slow-value-update assumption $|\partial Q/\partial N| \ll 1/N$, the stationary action condition recovers PUCT selection with $c_{\text{puct}} = \lambda/\sqrt{2}$.

*Proof*: The path probability is $P(\gamma) \propto \exp(-S[\gamma]/\hbar_{\text{eff}})$.
Stationarity requires:
$$\frac{\delta S}{\delta N(s,a)} = \frac{1}{N(s,a) + \varepsilon_N} + O(|\partial Q/\partial N|) = 0$$

Treating $Q$ as constant during selection and Taylor expanding for small $N(s,a)/N(s)$ yields the PUCT formula. □

## Part II: Quantum Dynamics

### 4. Hamiltonian Structure

**Definition 4.1** (Discrete Lagrangian with Kinetic Term):
The symmetric mid-point Lagrangian per information step:
$$\mathcal{L}_N = \underbrace{[\log N^{\text{pre}} + \lambda \log P - \beta Q]}_{\text{potential}} + \underbrace{\frac{\kappa_N}{2\delta\tau_N}(\phi_{N+1} - \phi_N)^2}_{\text{kinetic}}$$

where $\phi_{\sigma,N} := \log N^{\text{pre}}(\sigma,N)$ and $\delta\tau_N = 1/(N_{\text{root}} + 2)$.

**Definition 4.2** (Canonical Momentum):
$$\pi_{\sigma,N} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_N}{\partial(\Delta\phi/\delta\tau_N)} = \kappa_N \frac{\phi_{N+1} - \phi_N}{\delta\tau_N}$$

**Theorem 4.1** (Hamiltonian from Discrete Legendre Transform):
The operator Hamiltonian follows from the discrete Legendre transformation:
$$\boxed{H = \sum_\sigma \left[\frac{1}{2\kappa_N}\hat{\pi}_\sigma^2 + V_\sigma(\hat{N})\right]}$$

where:
- **Potential**: $V_\sigma(\hat{N}) = -[\log \hat{N} + \lambda \log P - \beta Q]$
- **Kinetic**: $\hat{\pi}_\sigma = -i\hbar_{\text{eff}} \partial/\partial\phi_\sigma$ 
- **Hopping strength**: $\kappa_N = \kappa_0/\sqrt{N_{\text{root}} + 1}$

**Matrix Representation**:
$$H_{\text{diag}} = \sum_{(s,a)} V_{s,a}|(s,a)\rangle\langle(s,a)|$$
$$H_{\text{hop}} = \sum_{(s,a) \sim (s',a')} \kappa_N |(s',a')\rangle\langle(s,a)| + \text{h.c.}$$

*Note*: The kinetic term $\frac{1}{2\kappa_N}\hat{\pi}^2$ manifests as hopping between neighboring edges, while the potential $V_\sigma$ provides diagonal terms. This construction ensures consistency between path integral and Hamiltonian formulations.

### 5. Lindblad Master Equation

**Definition 5.1** (Discrete Information Time Step):
$$\delta\tau_N = \frac{1}{N_{\text{root}} + 2}$$

This discrete step advances exactly one unit of information time, where $\tau = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \delta\tau_k = \log(N+2)$ in the continuum limit.

**Definition 5.2** (Jump Operators):
$$L_{s,a} = \sqrt{\gamma_{s,a}} |(s,a)\rangle\langle(s,a)|$$

where the decoherence rate per information time:
$$\gamma_{s,a} = g_0 \frac{N^{\text{pre}}(s,a) + \varepsilon_N}{\delta\tau_N}$$

with $g_0$ dimensionless and **causality preserved** by using pre-update visit counts $N^{\text{pre}}$.

**Theorem 5.1** (Discrete Kraus Evolution):
The single-step discrete Lindblad map is implemented via Kraus operators:
$$\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
K_0 &= \mathbb{1} - i\delta\tau_N \frac{H}{\hbar_{\text{eff}}} - \frac{1}{2}\delta\tau_N \sum_\alpha L_\alpha^\dagger L_\alpha \\
K_\alpha &= \sqrt{\delta\tau_N} L_\alpha
\end{aligned}
}$$

Evolution: $\rho_{N+1} = \sum_\mu K_\mu \rho_N K_\mu^\dagger$

*Proof*: This construction preserves trace: $\sum_\mu K_\mu^\dagger K_\mu = \mathbb{1} + O(\delta\tau_N^2)$ and yields the continuous Lindblad generator in the limit $\delta\tau_N \to 0$. □

**Theorem 5.2** (Effective Planck Constant):
The effective Planck constant emerges as:
$$\hbar_{\text{eff}}(N) = \hbar\left[1 + \frac{\Gamma_N}{2}\right]$$

where $\Gamma_N = \sum_{s,a} \gamma_{s,a}$ is the total decoherence rate.

**Lemma 5.1** (Parameter Consistency):
For complete positivity, the Kraus constraint requires:
$$\gamma_{s,a} \delta\tau_N \leq 1 \quad \text{for all } (s,a)$$

This bounds the decoherence strength $g_0$ relative to visit counts and information time scale.

## Implementation Notes: Discrete-Time Corrections

**Critical Implementation Requirements**:

1. **Information Time Evolution**: The discrete Lindblad map must advance exactly one unit of information time using $\delta\tau_N = 1/(N_{\text{root}} + 2)$, not arbitrary time steps.

2. **Hamiltonian Consistency**: The Hamiltonian must be derived via proper discrete Legendre transformation from the Lagrangian, not constructed ad-hoc from the action.

3. **Causality Preservation**: All operators ($H$, $L_\alpha$) must be evaluated using **pre-update** visit counts $N^{\text{pre}}$ to maintain causality in the discrete evolution.

4. **Parameter Bounds**: The Kraus constraint $\gamma_{s,a} \delta\tau_N \leq 1$ must be enforced to preserve complete positivity.

These corrections ensure mathematical consistency between the path integral, Hamiltonian, and Lindbladian formulations.

## Part III: Quantum Corrections

### 6. One-Loop on Trees

**Theorem 6.1** (Diagonal Hessian - Updated Implementation):
For tree structures, the action Hessian is diagonal:
$$H_{kk'} = \delta_{kk'} h_k, \quad h_k = \frac{1}{N_k^{\text{pre}} + \varepsilon_N}$$

*Proof*: Tree paths have no interaction between different depths since $\mathcal{L}[\gamma] = \sum_k \mathcal{L}(u_k)$. Thus $\partial^2\mathcal{L}/\partial u_k \partial u_{k'} = 0$ for $k \neq k'$. □

**Implementation Note**: When using KL divergence-based classical action, the effective diagonal Hessian should include global coupling effects: $h_k = \frac{1}{N_k + \varepsilon_N} \cdot (1 - N_k/N_{\text{total}})$. This captures the non-diagonal structure while maintaining computational efficiency. See `consistent_quantum_corrections.md` for details.

**Lemma 6.1** (Gaussian Approximation):
For $N_k \geq 5$, Stirling's approximation justifies treating discrete $\delta u_k$ as continuous. For smaller $N_k$, the discrete sum yields the same $\log(N_k + \varepsilon_N)$ correction up to $O(1/N)$. □

**Theorem 6.2** (One-Loop Effective Action):
$$\Gamma_{\text{1-loop}} = S_{\text{cl}} + \frac{\hbar_{\text{eff}}}{2}\sum_k \log h_k$$

### 7. UV Cutoff

**Definition 7.1** (Visit Threshold Cutoff):
$$N_{\text{UV}} = N_{\text{parent}}^{\alpha_{\text{UV}}}$$

where empirically $\alpha_{\text{UV}} \in [0.3, 0.7]$ balances exploration and exploitation.

**Note**: The theoretical value $\alpha_{\text{UV}} = 1/(1 + \epsilon_{\text{coh}}\Delta E_N)$ with $\Delta E_N \approx \beta\langle|Q|\rangle$ requires game-specific calibration.

## Part IV: Renormalization Group

### 8. Discrete RG Flow

**Theorem 8.1** (RG Recursion Relations):
Integrating out $b$ low-visit edges with parent count $N_p$:

$$\lambda' = \lambda - \frac{\hbar_{\text{eff}} b}{N_p}$$
$$\beta' = \beta\left(1 + \frac{b}{2N_p}\right)$$
$$\hbar_{\text{eff}}' = \hbar_{\text{eff}} + \frac{\gamma_0 b}{2N_p}$$

where $\gamma_0$ is the bare decoherence strength.

**Theorem 8.2** (Beta Functions):
In the continuum limit $\ell = \log b$:

$$\beta_\lambda = -\hbar_{\text{eff}}$$
$$\beta_\beta = \frac{\beta}{2}$$
$$\beta_{\hbar} = \frac{\gamma_0}{2}$$

**Corollary 8.1** (PUCT Decay):
$$c_{\text{PUCT}}(\ell) = \frac{\lambda(\ell)}{\beta(\ell)} \sim e^{-\ell/2} \sim N^{-1/2}$$

---

## Part V: Crossover Phenomena

### 9. Quantum-Classical Crossover

**Theorem 9.1** (Crossover, Not Phase Transition):
For finite trees with finite simulations, the system exhibits a smooth crossover, not a true phase transition. The Liouvillian gap never exactly closes for finite $N$.

**Definition 9.1** (Crossover Regimes):
- **Quantum regime**: $N \lesssim 100$, $\Gamma < 2\kappa$
- **Crossover fan**: $\Gamma \approx 2\kappa$, maximum entropy slope
- **Classical regime**: $N \gtrsim 1000$, $\Gamma > 2\kappa$

**Note**: True phase transition requires limits $b \to \infty$, $N \to \infty$.

### 10. Quantum Darwinism

**Theorem 10.1** (Pointer States):
The pointer basis consists of edge states $\{|s,a\rangle\}$ which are eigenstates of all jump operators.

**Theorem 10.2** (Information Redundancy):
After $k$ independent simulations, mutual information:
$$I(S:F_1,...,F_k) = H(S)[1 - (1-1/b)^k]$$

approaches the system entropy $H(S)$.

**Note**: Independence assumes Dirichlet noise decorrelates rollouts. In self-play without noise, effective sample size is reduced.

---

## Part VI: Parallel Coordination

### 11. Phase-Kicked Policies

**Theorem 11.1** (Destructive Interference):
When $M$ threads explore edge $(s,a)$ with phases $\theta_m = \pi m/M_{\max}$:
$$|A_{\text{total}}|^2 = |A_{s,a}|^2 \cdot \frac{\sin^2(M\pi/2M_{\max})}{\sin^2(\pi/2M_{\max})} \approx \frac{|A_{s,a}|^2}{M^2}$$

**Lemma 11.1** (Complete Positivity):
CP is preserved if all threads release locks before selection, ensuring $\sum_\sigma |K_\sigma|^2 = 1$.

**Note**: Asynchronous updates require atomic lock-reference counting.

### 12. MinHash Clustering

**Definition 12.1** (Quantized MinHash):
For continuous priors, first quantize into $B$ buckets:
$$\tilde{P}(a|s) = \lfloor B \cdot P(a|s) \rfloor / B$$

Then apply MinHash to discretized representation.

**Theorem 12.1** (Policy Clustering):
Similar policies receive phases differing by $O(1-J)$ where $J$ is Jaccard similarity, enabling automatic progressive widening.

1. **Path integral**: $Z = \sum_\gamma \exp(-S[\gamma]/\hbar_{\text{eff}})$
2. **Discrete-time quantum evolution**: $\delta\tau_N = 1/(N_{\text{root}} + 2)$ advances exactly one information time unit
3. **Hamiltonian from Legendre transform**: $H = \frac{1}{2\kappa_N}\hat{\pi}^2 + V(\hat{N})$ with proper kinetic and potential terms
4. **Discrete Kraus dynamics**: $\rho_{N+1} = \sum_\mu K_\mu \rho_N K_\mu^\dagger$ with causality-preserving pre-update counts
5. **Decoherence-driven annealing**: $\hbar_{\text{eff}}(N) = \hbar[1 + \Gamma_N/2]$
6. **Emergent PUCT**: From stationary action principle
7. **RG flow**: $c_{\text{PUCT}} \sim N^{-1/2}$ from discrete blocking
8. **Crossover dynamics**: Smooth quantum → classical transition
9. **Parallel coordination**: Via destructive interference

**Key Implementation Insight**: Mathematical consistency requires discrete-time formulation with proper Legendre transformation and causality-preserving operator evaluation. All parameters are measurable from tree statistics, providing principled exploration beyond heuristic tuning.
