# Quantum MCTS Implementation Changes Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes all changes made to implement the corrected quantum MCTS formulation with the quadratic kernel action and exact augmented PUCT formula.

## 1. Core Formula Updates

### One-Loop Corrections Module (`one_loop_corrections.py`)

**Changed**:
- Classical action from Hellinger to quadratic kernel: S_cl = κ*N_total*Σ(√q_k - p_k)²
- Hessian computation to exact formula: h_k = (κ*p_k/2)*sqrt(N_total/N_k³)
- Added `compute_augmented_puct_scores()` method with fixed quantum bonus coefficient 3/4
- Added `compute_rg_counterterm()` for pruning entropy loss
- Added `compute_jarzynski_average()` for nonequilibrium verification

**Key Code**:
```python
QUANTUM_BONUS_COEFF = 0.75  # Exactly 3/4, no tuning!
quantum_bonus = (QUANTUM_BONUS_COEFF * hbar_eff) / safe_visits
```

### Unified Quantum MCTS (`unified_quantum_mcts.py`)

**Changed**:
- Updated `_apply_quantum_corrections()` to use fixed 3/4 coefficient
- Removed old incorrect Hessian approximations
- Added proper RG counter-term handling

## 2. New Visualizations

### Jarzynski Equality Analysis (`plot_jarzynski_equality.py`)

**Added**:
- Complete Jarzynski equality verification for pruning operations
- Work distribution analysis for different pruning strategies
- Temperature dependence (β ↔ 1/ℏ_eff mapping)
- 3D error landscape visualization
- Crooks fluctuation theorem verification

**Key Features**:
- Shows how RG term ℏ_eff*log(1+B_trim) emerges from nonequilibrium physics
- Verifies <exp(-W/T)> = exp(-ΔF/T) for information-time MCTS
- Demonstrates connection to statistical mechanics

## 3. Documentation Updates

### New Documentation (`quantum_mcts_corrected.md`)

**Created comprehensive documentation covering**:
- Corrected classical action with quadratic kernel
- Exact Hessian derivation
- One-loop quantum corrections with fixed 3/4 coefficient
- RG counter-term for pruning
- Jarzynski equality connection
- Implementation guidelines

### Key Corrections

1. **Action**: S_cl = κ*N_total*Σ(√q_k - p_k)² NOT Σ(√q_k - √p_k)²
2. **Hessian**: h_k = (κ*p_k/2)*sqrt(N_total/N_k³) EXACT, not approximation
3. **Quantum Bonus**: +3*ℏ_eff/(4*N_k) with coefficient 3/4 FIXED by theory
4. **RG Term**: ΔΓ_RG = ℏ_eff*log(1+B_trim) added per parent

## 4. Physics Insights

### Jarzynski Mapping

The pruning operation maps to nonequilibrium thermodynamics:
- Information temperature: T = ℏ_eff
- Work: W = ΔS_hard (entropy cost)
- Free energy change: ΔF = ℏ_eff*log(1+b)

### RG Counter-Term Effects

The term ℏ_eff*log(1+B_trim):
- Accounts for entropy loss from pruning
- Improves diversity by penalizing aggressive pruning
- Manifests as -ℏ_eff*log(1+b)/N per-visit penalty
- Acts like principled progressive widening

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

### For Developers

1. **Use Fixed Coefficient**: The quantum bonus coefficient is exactly 0.75
2. **Include Priors**: Hessian computation requires neural network priors p_k
3. **RG Term**: Add once per parent, not per child
4. **Parameter Tuning**: Only tune κ (c_puct) and β, NOT the quantum coefficient

### Configuration

```python
config = OneLoopConfig(
    kappa=1.0,              # c_puct exploration
    beta=1.0,               # value weight
    include_rg_counterterm=True,  # enable pruning penalty
    hbar_eff=1.0            # or auto-compute
)
```

## 6. Validation

The implementation has been validated against:
1. Exact mathematical derivations
2. Jarzynski equality (nonequilibrium consistency)
3. Classical PUCT recovery in ℏ_eff → 0 limit
4. Proper scaling behavior

## Summary

This update provides the mathematically correct quantum MCTS implementation with:
- Exact augmented PUCT formula
- Fixed quantum bonus coefficient 3/4
- RG counter-term for pruning
- Jarzynski equality connection
- Comprehensive visualization tools

The formulation is now complete, rigorous, and ready for both research and production use.
