### Using High-Performance MCTS
```python
from mcts.core.mcts import MCTS
from mcts.core.mcts_config import MCTSConfig
from mcts.core.game_interface import GameInterface, GameType

# Create optimized MCTS configuration
config = MCTSConfig()
config.num_simulations = 800
config.device = 'cuda'
config.enable_fast_ucb = True

# Create MCTS instance
game_interface = GameInterface(GameType.GOMOKU, board_size=15)
mcts = MCTS(config, evaluator, game_interface)

# Run search
policy = mcts.search(game_state, num_simulations=800)
```
