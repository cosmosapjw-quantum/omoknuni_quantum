### Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd omoknuni_quantum

# Install Python dependencies (requires CUDA for GPU acceleration)
cd python
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build C++ components
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

### Basic Training
```bash
# Run optimized Gomoku training
python train.py --config configs/gomoku_classical.yaml

# Training will show clean progress bars:
# Training iterations: 15%|███▋      | 150/1000 [02:45<15:32, 0.91iter/s]

```

### Using High-Performance MCTS
```python
from mcts.core.mcts import MCTS
from mcts.core.mcts_config import MCTSConfig
from mcts.core.game_interface import GameInterface, GameType

# Create optimized MCTS configuration
config = MCTSConfig()
config.num_simulations = 800
config.device = 'cuda'
config.enable_fast_ucb = True

# Create MCTS instance
game_interface = GameInterface(GameType.GOMOKU, board_size=15)
mcts = MCTS(config, evaluator, game_interface)

# Run search
policy = mcts.search(game_state, num_simulations=800)
```
