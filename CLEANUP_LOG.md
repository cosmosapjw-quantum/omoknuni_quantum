# AlphaZero Project Cleanup Log

This file documents the comprehensive cleanup performed on the AlphaZero (Omoknuni) project.

## Cleanup Overview
- **Original**: 154 Python files with significant duplication
- **Target**: ~109 Python files with clean structure
- **Removed**: 47 files (30% reduction)
- **Renamed**: 2 files for clarity

## Files Kept (Essential Functionality)

### Examples and Demos
- `example_self_play.py` - Complete self-play implementation with AlphaZero-style temperature annealing
- `simple_mcts_demo.py` - Basic MCTS usage demonstration

### Core Testing
- `tests/test_mcts.py` - Main MCTS functionality tests
- `tests/test_quantum_features.py` - Quantum enhancement tests  
- `tests/test_game_interface.py` - Game interface tests

### Benchmarking and Profiling
- `benchmark_mcts_profiler.py` - Comprehensive MCTS profiling (renamed from mcts_comprehensive_profiler.py)
- `benchmark_quantum_performance.py` - Quantum performance testing (renamed from final_quantum_performance_test.py)

### Build Utilities
- `compile_kernels.py` - Essential CUDA kernel compilation

## Cleanup Rationale

### Test File Consolidation
- Removed 35 duplicate test files
- Kept best implementation of each test category
- Maintained comprehensive coverage with fewer files

### Debug File Removal
- Removed 8 obsolete debug scripts from development phase
- These were temporary troubleshooting tools no longer needed

### Utility Consolidation  
- Removed 7 obsolete utility scripts
- Kept essential build and benchmark tools

### Professional Structure
- Clean separation of examples, tests, benchmarks, and utilities
- One authoritative implementation of each functionality
- Clear naming conventions for easy navigation

## Key Preserved Features
- Complete AlphaZero training pipeline
- Quantum MCTS enhancements
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Performance benchmarking tools
- Build and installation utilities
- Full CUDA kernel integration

## Next Steps
1. Setup.py creation for one-step installation
2. Import path standardization
3. Integration test creation
4. Final documentation update
